Welcome to my GitHub repository! 

I am a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity professional with experience in risk assessment, security audits, and incident response. With certifications in CompTIA Security+, Network+, Server+, Google Cybersecurity, and proficiency in Python, SQL, and Linux Bash, I continuously strive to expand my expertise with the intention of contributing to the cybersecurity community.


Throughout my career, I have successfully improved operational efficiencies, enhanced IT infrastructure security, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to achieve significant results. My educational background along side my work experience at ADNA Technologies, Hanwha Techwin, and the University of Houston has equipped me with a deep understanding of the cybersecurity landscape and the ability to address complex security challenges.

## Objective
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in programming, data manipulation, and security analysis. From developing interactive Python scripts to mastering SQL data manipulation, each project reflects my commitment to understanding and mitigating cyber threats. I have hands-on experience with a variety of security tools, including Nmap, Wireshark, tcpdump, and the ELK Stack, and I am well-versed in frameworks like NIST SP 800-61.

I am eager to transition into this field and excited to share my projects and insights with you. Whether you are a fellow cybersecurity enthusiast, a potential employer, or simply curious about my work, I hope you find this repository informative and inspiring. 

Let's connect and work together to make the digital world a safer place!
